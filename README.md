# contact-me
A "Virtual Business Card" -- group 2's term project

**SETUP**
/src/contactme.sql is where you will find our database file. You are going to want to go into phpMyAdmin and create a database called `contactme`. Then, you can import the sql file mentioned above. We have created some users and groups to get you started. That information can be found below. The last thing you need to know that can't be done on our site is how to make a user an admin. This can be done in phpMyAdmin by changing the is_admin column from 0 to 1 for the user you would like to be an admin. Admin privileges include creating, editing, and deleting groups.
