# contact-me
A "Virtual Business Card" -- group 2's term project

**SETUP**
/src/contactme.sql is where you will find our database file. You are going to want to go into phpMyAdmin and create a database called `contactme`. Then, you can import the sql file mentioned above. We have created some users and groups to get you started. That information can be found below. The last thing you need to know that can't be done on our site is how to make a user an admin. This can be done in phpMyAdmin by changing the is_admin column from 0 to 1 for the user you would like to be an admin. Admin privileges include creating, editing, and deleting groups.

**Navigating Our Website**

    Our group, JAC, created a website called ContactMe, which is a virtual business card that makes networking and saving contacts with people you meet at events very easy. The way our website works is that if you want to host an event using ContactMe, you will have to sign up on our page to create a username, password, and password for your event. The event password is used when attendees arrive at the event and use their phone to scan the event’s QR code. The QR code will provide a password for the event and once attendees go on ContactMe, they will enter in that password so that they can be added as an attendee of that event. Attendees of an event will have to create an account on ContactMe so that they can join a group (also known as an event) using the password they were given from the QR code.
	
   When attendees create their account, their profile page will include their first name, last name, their social media, and the option to upload a profile picture. The picture size limit is 500,000 bytes (.5 MB/500 KB). There is also a link called “edit,” allowing users to make changes to their profile page. Once users make their changes, there will be a button on the bottom right called “save,” allowing all the changes to show on their profile page. 

    When a user logs in, there will be a group page listing all of the events he/she attended. On the groups page, users can click on an event they attended and once users click on an event/group, they will be taken to a page providing a description of the event, as well as a list of attendees for that event. The list of attendees will give users the opportunity to get in contact with people that were at the event, mainly those where they could not save or find their contact. When users click on an attendee’s profile page, their first name, last name, and social media will be provided. 

   When admins want to create a group, they must provide a title, description, and an image of the event. When admins create a group, they still have the option of editing the title,description, and image for an event. 

**Frontend (HTML, CSS, and Javascript, JSON/AJAX)**
   For the frontend part of our website, we wanted to make sure that the color theme was consistent on all pages, and users will see that we chose purple. We used different shades of purple with unique background images on the profile, logout, sign up, and edit pages. We made sure to include headers indicating the page the user is on, making it easier to navigate through our website. We also used HTML to provide the input fields for the following pages: login, sign up, edit page, create group page, and edit group page, so that users can input text. 

**Backend (PHP and mySQL)**
	For the backend part of our website, we are storing all the user information and group information in mySQL and using PHP to connect with and send queries to the database. 

 On the groups page where all of the list of groups joined, will show a list of the attendees, so people can connect with people after events. 


**Difficulties**
    When trying to put together the pages (profile, logout, sign up, and edit pages) where users had to input text in the fields, we had to make sure that that text area did not end up being the background image of the page. We had to make sure the background image would also fit the page and not be on the header area of our website. We searched for google images that would fit our purple theme and choose backgrounds that would appeal to our users. To avoid these errors and make sure the format of these pages were clean, we had to use chrome developer tools to look at the margins, to fix the alignment of the background images and the input fields, Other problems we ran into was allowing users to upload images when creating an account or making edits to their profile or groups page. 

**Future Plans**
    As of now, the only way a user can make themselves an admin is through phpmyadmin, but in the future we want users to be able to make themselves admins when they create an account. We want to also create QR codes that will provide the password for these groups. Lastly, we would like attendees of events to be able to follow each other and make friends with people they want to stay in contact with.
